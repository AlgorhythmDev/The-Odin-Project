    <p><h3>Paragraph 1:</h3></p>
    <p> Man, this is crazy. <em>finally </em> starting to learn how to code for real.
    it's honestly a great feeling and im sure I'll stick with it this time</p>

    <p><h3>Paragraph 2:</h3></p>
    <p><strong>Goals. </strong> What are my goals for this?  I honestly <em>don't know. </em>
    </p>

    <p><h3>Paragraph 3:</h3></p>
    <p>As of right now, I think my realest goal is just to stick with this for once, and truly learn.
        Maybe even learn some other languages after this and get into app development.
